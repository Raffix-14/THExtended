# THExtended

### **T**ransformer-based **H**ighlights **E**xtraction Extended to the news domain articles.

THExtended is a software developed by a team of four students from Politecnico di Torino: Alessio Paone, Flavio Spuri, Luca Zilli, and Luca Agnese. The project builds upon the work of Moreno La Quatra available at https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/THExt originally developed for the extraction of highlights in the scientific paper domain. It focuses on extracting highlights from textual documents using neural networks based on Transformers architecture.

The purpose of this project is not necessarily to improve the original work performances, given the limited hardware resources available. Instead, it serves as an academic project developed for a university examination. The team aimed to extend the functionality of the original work by introducing modifications and additional features.

## Extensions Description

The team made two extensions to the original project:

1. **News domain adaptation**: we adapted the THExt framework to the news domain. To do so, we also needed a new way to define a meaningful context, as we lose the intrinsic structure present in the scientific paper.

2. **Combining syntactic and semantic scores**: we analyzed the trade-ed  off between using a semantic score and a similarity score by introducing a novel modified scoring mechanism.
