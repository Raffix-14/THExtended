# THExtended

THExtended is a software developed by a team of four students from Politecnico di Torino: Alessio Paone, Flavio Spuri, Luca Zilli, and Luca Agnese. The project builds upon the work of Moreno La Quatra available at https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/THExt. It focuses on extracting highlights from textual documents using neural networks based on Transformers architecture.

The purpose of this project is not necessarily to improve the original work performances, given the limited hardware resources available. Instead, it serves as an academic project developed for a university examination. The team aimed to extend the functionality of the original work by introducing modifications and additional features.

## Extensions Description

The team made two extensions to the original project:

1. **Extension 1**: (Description of Extension 1) - In this extension, the team focused on a specific aspect of the software and made modifications to enhance efficiency, accuracy, or usability. New functionalities were introduced or existing ones were improved to meet the users' needs or address limitations and issues identified in the original project.

2. **Extension 2**: (Description of Extension 2) - In this second extension, the team addressed another key aspect of the software, concentrating on new features or significant improvements. Changes were made to the neural network model, highlight extraction algorithm, or other components of the system to achieve better results, optimize resources, or introduce new capabilities.


## Credits

The THExtended project was carried out by the following team members:

- Alessio Paone
- Flavio Spuri
- Luca Zilli
- Luca Agnese

They actively contributed to all the phases of the project, dedicating their efforts and expertise to realize this extended version of the software. The project is developed within the scope of an academic examination, and the team acknowledges the original work of Moreno La Quatra as the foundation for their project.
